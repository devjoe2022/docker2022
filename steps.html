Containerization using Docker
Now we will build (project goals). We will accomplish it in by completing each task in the project:

Task 1: Creation of a customised Docker image for a python application using Dockerfile

Task 2: Performing data persistence in Docker using Docker volumes

Task 3: Performing data copy from a Docker container to the Docker host.

Task 4: Creation of an image tar file from the Docker image and also retrieve back image from the tar file

Task 5: Creation of an image tar file directly from Docker container and also retrieve back image from the tar file 

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above-mentioned tasks. After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning
